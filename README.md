**How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?**

The clear answer to this question is through testing. However, as someone with no experience in this prior to this course, that can be easier said than done. Firstly, I needed to ensure that I understood the requirements as outlined. In order to do that, I do what I always do and wrote the requirements in a checklist style document that could be up on my second monitor and referenced whenever I needed it. Doing this, combined with some additional exploration into into testing via the internet, aided me in developing code that was functional and met the requirements outlined. 

**How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?**

When it comes to requirements, I begin by breaking down whatever documentation is given to me. With assignments in this course, I was fortunate enough to have the requirements outlined in a very simple manner. In other courses, sometimes I have been given transcripts of conversations or recordings to take requirements from. When going through these, I take the requirements of the customer and, as previously stated, put them into a checklist that I can reference throughout development. This ensures that all of the requirements are met and greatly reduce the chance that I miss something. 

**How do I approach designing software?**

After my checklist is complete, for assignments that take longer than a week like much of this class, I create a series of objectives. With those objectives, I create a schedule or calendar depending on the length of development. This gives each objective a specified amount of time to complete it and ultimately results in a final completion a day before the due date and gives me the last day time to look everything over to ensure that I am happy with it.
